## Find Below Design Suggestions
Hi, I noted a few design issues that could make the homepage much better. I will list them down categorically.

## Add to Cart

- There should be a total div section in the dropdown
- I should be able to add quantity from the cart dropdown without having to go to the same product
- There should be a remove anchor with an icon to remove a single product
- The Add to cart at the top of the "hero" image should be removed and added on hover if its that necessary


## Product List Section

- The div section of the product names should be aligned to have the divs to same size rather than them being affected by the lengthof the product name.
- The div on the last page of pagination is not fully displayed - developers should have a look at this too.
- Sorting can be improved by having a price range rather than using arrows that are barely visible. 
- Replace the arrows with sorting by asc or desc order.
- Customer can be made aware of the availability of the product

## Hero Image 

- Photo of the day can be a slider to increase interaction.

## General Improvements

- Font should be the same for the entire page and ie Size & type.
- There should be a footer section in any website
- people also buy can be moved to under sub products once a client clicks on a particular product then below they have a people also buy option Not after the hero image.

## Search Bar
- There should be a search bar at the header or just above the product list section
