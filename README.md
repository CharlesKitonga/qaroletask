## Task Solution Guidance

- The automation folder contains the files that I automated. Naming convention used is by what module has been automated.
- I used Selenium framework with Python for automating.
- The features' folder contains files that I wrote manual tests using the same naming convention. For manual tests I wrote them using Gherkin language.

## Bus

- I have also attached an Excel file with a bug report.

## Design Suggestions

- For design suggestions I have also attached a designsuggestions file that the developers can go through for insights.

## Questions

- Why do we have an add to cart button on top of the page?
- Why was a search bar not implemented on the home page?
